# AppointmentSystem

Virtual Appointment booking System for a hospital developed by using JAVA

###Appointment booking system for a hospital

##Task

Build an application that allows the external patients to login with their surname and date of birth for booking an appointment with the available doctors based on the specific date and time chosen by the user.

##Summary

This application was built using Netbeans and SceneBuilder. Netbeans comes with JAVA and JAVAFX programming language which allows me to implement the back-end of the application based on the principle of object oriented programming such as treating each patient and doctor as objects and each functionality as a method within the class. SceneBuilder was also used for implementing this application, the user interface and layout were all designed using SceneBuilder combined with JAVAFX for linking all the functionality from the back-end with the front-end of the application.

##Functionality

This application simulates the appointment booking system for a hospital in which a patient can login with their surname and date of birth, then the application will display the currently date, time and the doctors available for the patient to choose. Once the appointment has been made the user is then asked to confirm it, if the patient confirmed it cannot make an appointment again.

##Design

The design of this application followed the basic pattern of regular application such that it has login interface with clearly intructions on how to login, every buttons has it own label describes what is it and the application has an error handling functionality that display an pop-up error messages when the user raised some errors. Moreover, each user has it own unique username and password based on surname and date of birth.
